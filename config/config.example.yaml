  Software engineer working on AI-powered applications.
  Interested in practical ML tools and developer productivity.
  Works with LLMs, copilots, and agent frameworks daily.

# Interest categories (MECE structure)
# Guidelines:
# - high: Topics you actively seek. Score 0.7-1.0
# - medium: Interesting if relevant. Score 0.4-0.6
# - low: Only if exceptional. Score 0.1-0.3
# Tips:
# - Keep categories mutually exclusive (no overlaps)
# - Use parentheses for examples: "RAG (retrieval, vector DBs)"
# - 3-5 items per priority level is optimal
# - Be specific: "Claude Code" > "AI tools"
interests:
  high:
    - Agent architectures (multi-agent, orchestration, reasoning patterns, tool use)
    - Context engineering (RAG, retrieval, rerankers, embeddings, vector DBs)
    - AI workflow tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, agentic IDEs)

  medium:
    - LLM inference optimization (quantization, distillation, caching)
    - AI tutorials, guides, and use cases
    - Prompt engineering and structured outputs

  low:
    - Fine-tuning and model training
    - New model releases (benchmarks, announcements)

# Topics to exclude (relevance = 0)

  - Image generation (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney, Flux)
  - Video generation (Sora, Runway, Pika)
  - 3D generation and modeling
  - Audio and music generation
